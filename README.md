## neural-network-challenge-1

*This project implements a deep neural network through Tensorflow's Keras Sequential model to capture student data across various features to determine loan repayment success.

*Data was collected from a student loan dataset that was processed to create training and testing datasets for the model.

*The model is a 2-layer deep neural network that uses relu activation to output a singular neuron.

*The model was evaluated to determine accuracy and model loss.

*The model was then used to make predictions from training data to determine loan repayment success, with an accuracy of .74.
